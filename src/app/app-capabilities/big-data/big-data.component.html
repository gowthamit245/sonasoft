                <br>
                <p>We collaborate with IT and key business stakeholders to reach milestones for implementation. 
                Our infrastructure advisory and planning services are based on the following factors: 
                <span style="color: #fff;">Access: </span>Big data centric solutions store business critical data including 
                sensitive information about the customer, their financials and marketing, that are strictly governed by corporate 
                security and compliance policies. It is imperative that these types of businesses have access to big data, 
                    and the entire activity should be audited to satisfy regulatory compliance requirements. 
                    We understand these policies and incorporate different levels of access and control. 
                    <span style="color: #fff;">Capacity: </span>Our systems are designed to handle peta or exabytes and can be 
                    scaled seamlessly to fit customer needs. <span style="color: #fff;">“Scale-Out Clustered Architecture”</span>  
                    has the ability to add capacity in modules or arrays transparent to users without taking the system down. 
                    Since nodes of storage capacity with embedded processing power and connectivity can grow seamlessly, 
                    this architecture avoids the silos of storage utilized by traditional systems. A key advantage for deploying big data is to manage large numbers 
                    of files in different formats (logs, audio, video etc.). Managing these files reduces scalability and 
                    impacts performance. We take these factors into consideration during the planning phase and design an 
                    architecture to handle these specific situations. By leveraging object-based storage architecture,                        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <br>
                <p>big data storage systems can expand file counts into the billions without suffering overhead problems. 
                Object-based storage systems can also scale geographically, enabling large infrastructures to be spread 
                across multiple locations. To be able to harness the true power of distributed computing, it is essential 
                to have the right cluster to support it. There are multiple factors to consider in order to build the 
                correct organization specific cluster, such as:</p>
                <ul class="text-white">
                    <li>Size of data</li>
                    <li>Complexity of data</li>
                    <li>Complexity of algorithms</li>
                    <li>IOPS</li>
                    <li>Replication factor</li>
                    <li>High availability requirements</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span style="color: #fff;">Security:</span> Big data can be run in a secure mode by leveraging your existing identity management 
                infrastructure such as Active Directory, LDAP etc. This approach minimizes cost by eliminating 
                third party solutions and uses existing skills to achieve the following:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Integration with an existing Single Sign On, Active Directory, LDAP etc.</li>
                <li>Establish machine-to-machine communication across modes in the cluster.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span style="color: #fff;">Latency:</span> We make a difference in planning your big data infrastructure by understanding your key 
                business goals and revenue drivers.</p>

                <p>We will design a system with ideal performance and reduce the latency factor for real-time applications. 
                    As an early adopter of Apache Spark, we are also a certified systems integrator and trainer. 
                    We can leverage the in-memory distributing computing capabilities of Spark for real-time streaming 
                    and analytics. This is exactly why we utilize a <span style="color: #fff;">“Scale –Out Architecture,”
                    </span> so we can quickly enable the cluster of storage nodes to increase processing power. 
                    <span style="color: #fff;">Cost:</span> 
                    We understand the dynamics around controlling cost from start to finish. Our approach starts 
                    by defining the case, and then developing a plan to execute the project in a POC mode. 
                    This can be achieved in a variety of ways: Utilizing unused hardware to form a cluster for the 
                    POC Utilizing the open source software for the POC without having to invest in a specific 
                    big data distribution Developing the project to realize the business value from big data We 
                    start with a “Proof of Technology,” to evaluate various big data distributions based on goals, 
                    vision and cost considerations. Depending on specific big data technology or tools, we design 
                    a <span style="color: #fff;">“Scale-Out Architecture”</span> model without using an 
                    expensive hardware configuration upfront. Finally, we design a training strategy for organizations 
                    based on existing internal IT teams for skills adoption.</p>
